                <h1 class="subtitle">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a freshman at Emerald High and it hasalways been an interest of mine to pursue some sort of Computer Science path.
                     Even though this portfolio is only the beginning of my journey I hope that it can be a start to something great and 
                     enjoyable for me. For me, programming has always seemed like a very hard skill to learn and perfect. By starting small
                      and actually trying to come up with and do my own projects I have been able to start learning and it has been very aspiring 
                      so far.___  For the future I dont have any specific career path that I have decided to commit to and follow yet. As I
                       have already mentioned I only started coding this year so there has not been many projects that I was able to complete 
                       since many seemed too far out of my range yet.
